# Tetris

This Tetris game is a classic tile-matching puzzle video game built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.   
Players control the falling blocks, known as Tetriminos, as they descend into a playing field. The objective is to manipulate these Tetriminos by moving and rotating them to create complete horizontal lines without any gaps. When a line is completed, it clears from the playing field, and the player earns points. The game ends if the Tetriminos stack up to the top of the playing field, reaching a predetermined height. With its simple yet addictive gameplay, this Tetris game provides a nostalgic experience for players of all ages.
